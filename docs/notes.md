An example of a [dockerfile](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/docker/pytorch/Dockerfile) that creates a docker container with Python 3.6 and PyTorch installed.  

Updating a deployed model: [Data Stream Generation with Concept Drift](https://edouardfouche.com/Data-Stream-Generation-with-Concept-Drift/)  

SageMaker does automated hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian Optimization. Also, CloudWatch for logs generated during training.  

Creating an **endpoint that sends data to more than one model** (Ex: XGBoost and Linear models) and **how to update an existing endpoint** without any downtime for the user.
